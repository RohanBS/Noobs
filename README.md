# Noobs
RVCE Hackathon
The application records sound using the smartphone's MIC and finds the corresponding Decibel value (in real time). These values will be uploaded to the cloud after fixed intervals of time.
The uploaded data will be visualized on the cloud, and relevant inferences be drawn.
This project primarily aims to monitor noise pollution levels across the city and monitor them in real time on the cloud.
